# pytorch-chatbot
Simple chatbot implementation with PyTorch.

The implementation should be easy to follow for beginners and provide a basic understanding of chatbots.


The implementation is straightforward with a Feed Forward Neural net with 2 hidden layers.


Customization for your own use case is super easy. Just modify intents.json with possible patterns and responses and re-run the training .
